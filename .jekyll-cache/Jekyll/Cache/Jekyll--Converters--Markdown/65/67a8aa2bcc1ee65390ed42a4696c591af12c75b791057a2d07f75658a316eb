I"”<p>To get familiar with the cloud environment, getting hands on with a prominent cloud service provider, I think of having some experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although I have some familiarity with couple of AWS services like EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), S3 (Simple Storage Service) etc.</p>

<p>Starting off, first we need an AWS Account, for which I go for the student account as I am a Master student in Germany, So I just got the One year free account via AWS Educate. The best thing is they give you a One year free subsription for all the services available on free tier.</p>

<h1 id="starting-with-ec2-elastic-compute-cloud">Starting With EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</h1>

<p><strong>EC2</strong>, stands for Elastic Cloud Compute. It simply provides a scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using EC2 you donâ€™t have to care about any configuration security, networking and managed storage. You can easily scale up or down your machines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Itâ€™s just a click away from you. One just have to chose type of machine, select the hardware specifications, memory consumption and security group according to the roles and policies defined accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also provides Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software). Moreover you can create snapshots of your machines (Instances).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secure logins and access via different user groups and secure key pairs. Furthermore Firewall options (different incoming and outgoing rules applied to the server using security groups).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public/Static IPv4 addresses available for all EC2 instances also termed as Elastic IP addresses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many physical locations available for your resources, on different Regions and Availability Zones.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
